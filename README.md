## FTG Modules for [GeekTG/Friendly-Telegram](https://github.com/GeekTG/Friendly-Telegram)

Changes/addations/removeables made by LakesideMiners

* Replaced the afk module with the one from [HitaloSama/FTG-modules-repo](https://github.com/HitaloSama/FTG-modules-repo) as the GeekTG one did not have a rate limiter.
* Fox.py is my own creation. gets a fox from the [Sheri Bot API](https://sheri.bot/)
* timetill.py is my own creation. When used, prints how many days until I am 18. If it is less then 7 days, then it will print how many days, hours, minutes and then seconds until I am 18. 

* Translateing some strings to English
